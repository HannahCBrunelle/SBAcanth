#Sub-setting by a specific value within a variable
#No parasites found 
#K (mean 1.221) (min 0.741)(max 2.157)
Parasitized_no <- subset(DissectionsK, Parasitized == "No")

#Mean and SD of Condition Factors
NoMeanK <- mean(Parasitized_no$K, na.rm = TRUE) #1.221
NoSDK <- sd(Parasitized_no$K, na.rm = TRUE) #0.127


#####Shapiro Normality Test#####
#Add value to the histogram of the distribution
#The null-hypothesis of this test is that the population is normally distributed. 
#A data set with a p value of less than .05 rejects the null hypothesis that the data are from a normally distributed population
shapiro.test(Parasitized_no$FL_cm) 
shapiro.test(Parasitized_no$TL_cm) 
shapiro.test(Parasitized_no$BodyWWt_g) 
shapiro.test(Parasitized_no$K) #W = 0.91969, p-value = 1.777e-12

#Histograms
hist(Parasitized_no$FL_cm) #NOT NORMAL
hist(Parasitized_no$TL_cm) #NOT NORMAL
hist(Parasitized_no$BodyWWt_g) #NOT NORMAL
hist(Parasitized_no$K) #Show Katrina
